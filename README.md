NFC based Music System using Java

/*Project description in brief

For a Java project in my third year, my team and I decided to integrate hardware as well as software in order to implement a novel solution. We built a music system using Java that played music or playlists based on the specific mood of the user. This was done with the help of a pulse sensor that took readings every 2000 ms and compared it to references. The measurements were then processed using an Arduino. Since NFC is a built-in technology for most smartphone brands, we decided that we would use the IDs associated with each NFC chip to uniquely identify the user.
